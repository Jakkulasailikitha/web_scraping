                "reviewBody": "Rajesh Khanna had always won acclaim and registered his credits in the box office hits, whenever he portrayed a sentimental, morally strong and emotionally focused role. He also did a great job in SAFAR, wherein he portrayed a similar role of a cancer stricken patient.\n\nNevertheless, he is not well at portraying the roles of &quot;an angry man&quot;, &quot;a fighting sequence&quot;, &quot;an overly volatile role&quot; and &quot;clownish comedy roles&quot; that can all be performed in a masterly manner by his arch rival, Amitabh Bachan.\n\nHowever, Rajesh Khanna&apos;s personification of a lively, vivacious, death defying and winsome portrayal of a cancer stricken man was stupendously performed. His person consummately excels in mimicking soft, romantic, sad, morose and boisterously exuberant roles.\n\nMany people contend that Amitabh would had done a better characterization if he had been offered an author backed role instead of Rajesh Khanna in ANAND. Here it may be kept in mind that Amitabh could not match a stunning performance in MILLI, where his real life spouse Jaya Bahaduri outperformed him. \n\nThe bullock cart scene immediately followed by the song &quot;Kaheen door jab din dhal Jaye&quot; in ANAND speaks volumes of the excellently crafted direction of Hirsihkish Mukherjee and has enlisted his name among all time great directors. This song and the one &quot;Zindagi Kaisi he Paheli&quot; touch the latent strings of sublime imagination with poignant originality, which cannot even remotely be identified anywhere, among the fast, untamed, crazy and meaningless songs of this age of Indian Cinema ......which seems to be overly swamped by the temporal, vulgar and money minting mentality of the producers, directors and actors.\n\nThat is to say, there is nothing worthwhile in contemporary cinema, which happens to be laden with tawdry vulgarity and incompetent intellectual standing, vis-a-vis the cerebral and in-depth creativity of movie makers of erstwhile days.",
